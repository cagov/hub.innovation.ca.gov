We connect directly with Californians to improve state services. Here’s some of the work the Office of Data and Innovation (ODI) has done.Preview project page 1

### Helping more eligible families enroll in CalWORKs
CalWORKs is a major safety net program. There’s a gap between people eligible for benefits and those who get them. ODI explored why the gap exists. We interviewed applicants to learn what it’s like applying for CalWORKs. We also talked to program staff to hear what it’s like to run the program. We found pain points that stop families from getting the benefits they deserve.

### Lifting Californians’ voices in toxic substance cleanup project decisions
The Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) oversees cleanup projects across the state. They use comments from the public when deciding how to clean up sites. Most projects get only a few comments. DTSC asked ODI to explore how to reach people who don’t usually comment. ODI ran pilots to test new ways of reaching Californians. After making a few key changes, we got 600% more comments.

### Getting compensation to more California crime victims

California Victims Compensation Board (CalVCB) noticed a puzzling trend. Despite a rise in violent crimes, fewer victims applied for compensation. CalVCB asked ODI to find out why. Their goal was to get more applications. For 6 weeks, ODI talked with victims and those who support them. We used this research and best practices in design to find ways to make it easier to apply.

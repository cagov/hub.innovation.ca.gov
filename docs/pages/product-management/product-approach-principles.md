<p class="text-lead">Product approach is a user-centric approach to designing and delivering products and services. A product approach focuses on solving business problems and meeting users’ needs. This approach improves Californians’ lives by delivering services that provide what they need when they need it.</p>

## Our work

ODI functions as a government-to-government (G2G) service by consulting with other state departments. We work with each partner department to provide exceptional customer experiences for Californians.

We model a product approach in our work with these partners. We train partners in departments to build services according to product approach principles. We help design and delivery products with user needs first. The result is more equitable service delivery and increased trust between the people and their government.

## Our product principles

### 1. Establish the product vision

ODI helps to establish a vision and purpose for a project by asking our partners in state departments:

* What are we trying to achieve?
* Why is this important to the Californians we serve?
* How will this advance our department’s goals and mission?

We use what we learn to understand why a project is important to our partners and what it aims to achieve. Once we define the vision and purpose, we have clear expectations. We empower subject matter experts, stakeholders and product teams to work towards the shared goal.

### 2. Prioritize people’s needs

As a G2G consultant with other departments, ODI empowers departments to focus on the needs of Californians. Together, we focus on understanding all customers so we can address their needs.

Our customers are everyone impacted by a service or technology. This can include:

* Department or agency executives
* Program staff
* IT staff
* California residents
* California State Legislature
* The Governor’s Administration

### 3. Accurately define the problem

ODI starts by understanding and defining the right problem before we start any consultation or work.

This includes modeling product approach by helping departments:

* Research problem background
* Research user needs
* Map customers, users, and stakeholders
* Define user journeys
* Understand current business processes
* Interpret available data
* Any other organizational or strategic considerations

This research supports the collaborative creation of a product vision, strategy, and roadmap. This process is iterative and can change as the product evolves.

### 4. Deliver early and often

ODI’s product approach affirms the benefits of continuous delivery and improvement. The goal is to develop and deliver business and user value early. As we work with our partners, we test assumptions to:

* Confirm that the solution effectively addresses user needs
* Manage risk
* Confirm the solution delivers value

ODI's product approach emphasizes ongoing, continual improvement throughout the entire project or engagement.

### 5. Measure success to meet customer need

ODI works **with** partners in state departments, not just **for** them. We use data to evaluate our progress toward our partners goals. This data empowers the team to make strategic decisions. Our approach helps partners adjust their priorities based on feedback and evolving user needs.

We include clear and measurable data in our product roadmaps to:

* Understand people’s goals
* Deliver the best experience within budget and timelines
* Decide if we need to change direction

### 6. Empower the team

In order for ODI’s product approach to work best, any team we partner with has to be:

* Empowered to be creative
* Willing to ask “why” questions
* Open to bringing their ideas and experience as subject matter experts to the problem or project

We bring team members into prioritization and decision making. We foster shared ownership and accountability for outcomes. We collaborate across teams to leverage the expertise of different disciplines.

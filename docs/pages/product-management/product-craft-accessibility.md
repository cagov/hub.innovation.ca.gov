Making things accessible is an important part of product management. These are the ODI product managers’ favorite accessibility resources.

## Web content

* The Department of Rehabilitation’s (DOR) [Web Accessibility Toolkit](https://dor.ca.gov/Home/WebAccessibilityToolkit) is a great place to start.
* The [California Design System](https://designsystem.webstandards.ca.gov) is accessible out of the box.

## PDFs (portable documents)

The federal Accessible Electronic Document Community of Practice has [PDF training videos](https://www.section508.gov/create/pdfs/training-videos/). They explain and show how to make PDFs meet federal Section 508 requirements.

[Module 3: Remediating PDFs for Accessibility](https://www.section508.gov/training/pdfs/aed-cop-pdf03/) describes how to:

* Fix a PDF’s properties
* Add and adjust tags
* Adjust the reading and tab order
* Add alternative text to images and objects
* Set the document’s language properties

DOR has a guide on [creating accessible content](https://dor.ca.gov/Home/HowToCreateAccessibleContent). They have a section on creating accessible PDFs.

## Presentations

DOR’s guide on [creating accessible content](https://dor.ca.gov/Home/HowToCreateAccessibleContent) also has a section on PowerPoint.

## Videos

* Build Capable has a guide on [how to add closed captions to videos](https://www.buildcapable.com/how-to-add-closed-captions-to-your-videos/) that people can turn on and off.
* We also like the UK’s National Health Service [accessibility guidance for content](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/accessibility/content). It covers:
  * Audio description
  * Closed captions
  * Transcripts

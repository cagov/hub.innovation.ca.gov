<p class="text-lead">A run-of-show tracker is a single unified table, organized by day and time.</p>

It’s sometimes called a “tick tock”. It’s a countdown to any launch and can even go beyond.

It maps out the sequence of events to be sure you’ve covered every angle. It also makes sure the process is reviewed and approved. The run-of-show is a real-time checklist for making sure the “show” goes on as planned.

You can use a run-of-show for:

* A new product launch
* A site change timed to an announcement or campaign
* A major update that requires alignment across multiple stakeholders
* Any complex delivery that requires orchestrating dependencies across multiple teams

## Example

The headings provide guidance on what goes in each row. We’ve provided 3 example rows to give a sense of what a run-of-show looks like in practice.

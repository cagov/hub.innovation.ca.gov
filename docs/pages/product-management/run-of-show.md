<p class="text-lead">A run-of-show tracker is a real-time checklist for a launch or update.</p>

It’s a single unified table, organized by day and time. This is why it’s sometimes called a “tick tock”.

It maps out the sequence of events to be sure you’ve covered every angle. It also makes sure the process is reviewed and approved. The run-of-show makes sure the “show” goes on as planned.

You can use a run-of-show for:

* A new product launch
* A site change timed to an announcement or campaign
* A major update that requires alignment across multiple stakeholders
* Any complex delivery that requires orchestrating dependencies across multiple teams

## Example: New license fee launch

Here’s an example of what a run-of-show for updating license fees might look like.

The headings provide guidance on what goes in each row. We’ve provided 3 example rows to give a sense of what a run-of-show looks like in practice.

<p class="text-lead">The Government Operations Agency (GovOps) and the California Office of Data and Innovation (ODI) are launching the Innovation Showcase program. Government teams will get to hear from innovators about challenges facing delivery of services to residents. The Showcase will bridge the gap between the public and private sectors. It will start conversations about what’s possible through regular market research.</p>

Whether you’re a vendor or an innovator, we want to hear from you!

## April opportunity

**Streamlining and improving survivors’ rebuilding experience**

*Los Angeles experienced devastating wildfires in January, 2025. Rebuilding is a complex and evolving process. The state wants to make it easier for survivors to rebuild and recover.*

We want to hear your proposal for how to immediately support survivors and/or the state’s rebuilding efforts.

## Upcoming Innovation Showcase

We will invite selected innovators whose solutions best address the April challenge to present to state leaders and teams. The Innovation Showcase is not open to the public and will not be recorded. Innovators will be allowed to watch other innovators’ presentations. The Showcase will be held via Zoom, from 1:00 - 3:00 PM on Wednesday, April 30, 2025.

## Types of solutions

We welcome all kinds of solutions. You may apply with an IT or technical solution. We’re especially interested in non-IT solutions that are community-, process-, or accessibility-based. We encourage both private and non-profit organizations to apply.

## What happens after presenting at the Showcase

The Innovation Showcase program is strictly for market research. **It is not the beginning of, nor a promise of, a procurement.** State teams across entities and departments will join to learn about innovation opportunities.

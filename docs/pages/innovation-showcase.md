<p class="text-lead">The Government Operations Agency (GovOps) and the California Office of Data and Innovation (ODI) are launching the Innovation Showcase program. Government teams will get to hear from innovators about challenges facing delivery of services to residents. The Showcase will bridge the gap between the public and private sectors. It will start conversations about what’s possible through regular market research.</p>

Whether you’re a vendor or an innovator, we want to hear from you!

## April opportunity

*Los Angeles experienced devastating wildfires in January, 2025. Rebuilding is a complex and evolving process. The state wants to make it easier for survivors to rebuild and recover.*

<p class="text-lead">The Government Operations Agency (GovOps) and the California Office of Data and Innovation (ODI) are launching the Innovation Showcase program. Government teams will get to hear from innovators about challenges facing delivery of services to residents. The Showcase will bridge the gap between the public and private sectors. It will start conversations about what’s possible through regular market research.</p>

Whether you’re a vendor or an innovator, we want to hear from you!

## Program format

### Rolling submissions

The Showcase accepts any innovator pitch on a rolling basis. If you have an innovative idea or solution, [we want to hear from you](https://airtable.com/appcy9MspSTfFx0xl/pagaEbNCkJbrQKMD1/form)! GovOps and ODI will review submissions regularly. We will schedule ad hoc Showcase days to allow selected innovators to share their ideas with state teams. You only need to submit a solution one time for it to be considered for the rolling submission and ad hoc Showcases.

### Specific challenge statement opportunities

There will also be opportunities to respond to specific challenge statements. Challenge statements will be posted on this page when we are accepting applications. Applications will have a due date for specific challenge statements. We will invite selected innovators whose solutions best address the challenge to present to state leaders and teams. The Innovation Showcase is not open to the public and will not be recorded. Innovators will be allowed to watch other innovators’ presentations.

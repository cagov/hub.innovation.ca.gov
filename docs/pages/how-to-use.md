<p class="text-lead">The Innovation Hub collects resources made and found by the Office of Data and Innovation (ODI). We share them to help state departments better serve Californians.</p>

Here are our recommendations for how to use each type of resource on the Hub.

## Standards and principles

They’re the big ideas that guide ODI’s work. If you’re new to a topic, standards and principles are a good place to start.

## Guides and playbooks

These offer details about how to implement a standard or best practice. They can include step-by-step instructions to achieve a goal. Use guides and playbooks when doing work to achieve a great outcome.

## Training

Our training gives you access to best practices in innovation. They’re a great way to improve your knowledge and skills so you can deliver better services.

## Recommended reading

ODI is always researching how to deliver great services. We save our favorite articles and tools to use them in our work. Our recommended reading is a good way to dive into a topic and expand your knowledge.

## Templates

We often make templates to streamline our work. Take our templates and use them as-is, or change them to fit your department, to make your work easier.

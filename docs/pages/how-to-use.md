<p class="text-lead">The Innovation Hub collects resources made and found by the Office of Data and Innovation (ODI). We share them to help state departments better serve Californians.</p>

Here are our recommendations for how to use each type of resource on the Hub.

## Standards and principles

They’re the big ideas that guide ODI’s work. If you’re new to a topic, standards and principles are a good place to start.

## Guides and playbooks

These offer details about how to implement a standard or best practice. They can include step-by-step instructions to achieve a goal. Use guides and playbooks when doing work to achieve a great outcome.

## Training

Our training gives you access to best practices in innovation. They’re a great way to improve your knowledge and skills so you can deliver better services.

## Recommended reading

ODI is always researching how to deliver great services. We save our favorite articles and tools to reference them in our work. Our recommended reading is a good way to dive into a topic and expand your knowledge.

## Templates

We often make templates to streamline our work. Take our templates and use them to make your work easier. Feel free to change them to fit your department.

We’ve organized resources by topic. The topics on the Hub are:

* Human-centered design
* Content design
* Product management

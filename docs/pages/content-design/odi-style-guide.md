These are the Office of Data and Innovation’s conventions and standard terms for writing. Our [content design principles](/content-design/principles/) provide general guidance in how to write well.

## Capitalization

Always use sentence case. It’s easier to read and understand. Only capitalize proper nouns and the first word of a sentence or bullet.

> Examples: 
> Your actions save lives
> Blueprint for a Safer Economy
> Public health orders are issued by the California Department of Public Health

When a word or phrase could correctly be written in title case or sentence case, default to sentence case.

When writing out a URL, use lowercase letters. But if it’s the first word in a sentence, capitalize the first letter.

> Examples:
> Check myturn.ca.gov for walk-in clinics in your area.
> Vaccines.gov is the CDC’s vaccination portal.

Capitalize acronyms.

> Example:
> CDC

Capitalize the suffix for time of day, and add a space before it.

> Example:
> 10:40 AM

When creating a link to a page or document on another website, use the same case for the link text that the visitor will find when they use the link.

> Example:
> [Fact Sheet: Omicron Variant](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Omicron-Variant-Fact-Sheet.aspx)

When making a bulleted list, capitalize the first word in each bullet.

> Example:
> The best thing we can do to limit virus spread and mutation is to:
> * Get vaccinated
> * Get your booster if you’re eligible

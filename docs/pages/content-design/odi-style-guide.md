description: How ODI keeps our writing consistent, including the reasons for our choices

These are the Office of Data and Innovation’s conventions and standard terms for writing. Our [content design principles](/content-design/principles/) provide general guidance in how to write well.

## Capitalization

Always use sentence case. It’s easier to read and understand. Only capitalize proper nouns and the first word of a sentence or bullet.

> Examples: 
> Your actions save lives
> Blueprint for a Safer Economy
> Public health orders are issued by the California Department of Public Health

When a word or phrase could correctly be written in title case or sentence case, default to sentence case.

When writing out a URL, use lowercase letters. But if it’s the first word in a sentence, capitalize the first letter.

> Examples:
> Check myturn.ca.gov for walk-in clinics in your area.
> Vaccines.gov is the CDC’s vaccination portal.

Capitalize acronyms.

> Example:
> CDC

Capitalize the suffix for time of day, and add a space before it.

> Example:
> 10:40 AM

When creating a link to a page or document on another website, use the same case for the link text that the visitor will find when they use the link.

> Example:
> [Fact Sheet: Omicron Variant](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Omicron-Variant-Fact-Sheet.aspx)

When making a bulleted list, capitalize the first word in each bullet.

> Example:
> The best thing we can do to limit virus spread and mutation is to:
> * Get vaccinated
> * Get your booster if you’re eligible

## Dates

Write out the month in a date. 

> Example: 
> January 15, 2022

Do not use only numbers, which can lead to confusion. Some cultures interpret 9/5/2020 as May 9, 2020 instead of September 5, 2020.

## Formatting

### Bulleted list

Use bulleted lists for a list of items that are related. They break up long blocks of text into shorter, easier-to-read lists. Do this wherever you have 2 or more nouns or verbs in a series.

Give context for your list with a lead-in sentence followed by a colon:

* Capitalize the first word in each bullet.
* Decide if your bullets will all be complete sentences or fragments. Do not mix both within one list. This confuses people.
  * If your bullets are complete sentences, end them with periods.
  * If your bullets are fragments, do not end them with periods.
* Do not make a list of more than two levels. This is hard for people to read. On websites, this often cramps text against the right margin on mobile devices.

### Buttons

On a website or digital service, use a button with a form or to highlight something people may want to do.

* Be short, descriptive, and distinctive.
* Start with an active verb like **Apply**, **Submit**, or **Search**. This keeps the focus on what people need to do.

Buttons make it easier to find and take actions.

### Headings

Use headings to break up blocks of text and make your content scannable.

People scan content, especially online, rather than reading every word. When there are large blocks of solid text, they often scan in an F-shaped pattern. This is inefficient and makes what they’re looking for easy to miss.

Headings serve as guideposts. They help people know which parts of the page they want to read more closely. Headings enable more efficient scanning, which looks like a layer-cake pattern.

To make your headings effective:

* Keep them short.
* Use sentence case. It’s easier to read and understand.
* Order headings (and your content) by priority. Start with what’s useful to most people and end with the information the fewest people need. If they are steps, go from first to last.
* Don’t use punctuation.
* Don’t make your heading a full sentence.
  * Example: **What we do** is better than **ODI does many things to help state departments**.
* Don’t write headings as questions. Convey certainty whenever you can, not uncertainty.
  * Example: **How the DIF helps** is better than **How does the DIF help?**
* Don’t skip heading levels. For example, don’t go straight from H2 to H4. Each level has its own style. Using levels consistently makes a good experience for readers. This also helps people using screen readers. 
* Nest heading levels appropriately. For example, H3s can be used for content relevant to the H2 above it. But don’t go past H4. That much nesting is hard for readers to follow.

### Links

Links are embedded in text instead of standing alone.

* Make the link title match the title of the destination page as much as possible. This helps people know they arrived in the right place.
  * Example: A link named [Quarantine and isolation](https://covid19.ca.gov/quarantine-and-isolation/) goes to a page named **Quarantine and isolation**.
* Do not use **See more**, **Learn more**, **Here**, or **View more** in link names. They do not give people a good idea where they’ll go. Some of these phrases also assume everyone can see.
* Limit the number of links. Too many links make the text hard to read. If you have several relevant links, put them in a bulleted list after your main text.
* Have links support comprehension, not disrupt it. People often open links when they come to them. Do not link until it’s alright to send the person away (after you’ve conveyed your point). 
* Open links in [the same tab and window](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G200.html). Only open content in a new tab or window when there’s a good reason to do so. Give people [warning when a new tab or window will open](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G201.html). This is especially important for people on mobile devices. Pages that open in new tabs can confuse people and disrupt their experience.

### Notes and disclaimers

When info (especially data in tables or graphs) needs an explanation, follow it with a note to provide clarity. Putting notes next to what they explain makes it easy for people to get more information if they want it. Make the note smaller to signal to the reader that it is secondary info. This makes it easy for people to skip the details if they want.

### Numbered list

Use numbered lists when you want to show information in a particular order. The numbers help people know there’s an order. They guide readers by providing a start and end. Do not use a numbered list if order does not matter.

> Example:
> To get your $50 card, just:
> * Get your code (via email or text within 7-10 days)
> * Redeem and pick your reward (within 90 days)

If you’re walking people through an important step-by-step process on a website, use a [step list component](https://designsystem.webstandards.ca.gov/components/step-list/readme/). It lets you add detail to each step and makes them more readable.

### Webpage titles

Browsers show a page title when you hover over the page tab. It helps people know what’s in a tab on their browser.

Make the title the same as the H1 of the page, followed by a pipe and the site name. This gives people a full understanding of the page.

> Example:
> Content style guide | California Design System

### Webpage URLs

Use the H1 of the page to create your URL. This helps search engines find the page.

Replace spaces in the title with hyphens so search engines can read them. Delete the conjunctions, prepositions, and articles as long as the URL still keeps the same meaning.

* A page titled **Request a birth certificate** would become **/request-birth-certificate**.
* Do not make **Prepare for a wildfire** into **/prepare-wildfire**. This has a different meaning.
* If your URL feels too long, consider shortening the page’s H1. Make sure both give enough detail so people know what the page is about.

Use the site map to build the URL. If the birth certificate page lives under a page called **Services**, the URL would be: **alpha.ca.gov/services/request-birth-certificate**.

## Numbers

### Abbreviations

#### Thousands (K)

Write out the number. This is clear to people, even after translation.

> Example: 
> Grants of up to $15,000 are available.

When writing numbers with limited space (like labels in a chart), use a K instead of writing out the full number.

For rates that use 100,000 as their base, use “per 100K.”

> Example: 
> 15.2 cases per 100K

#### Millions (M)

For exact numbers where every digit is important, write out the whole number.

> Example: 
> 15,435,899 cases

For round or approximate numbers, write out the word “million.” Use up to one decimal point. Do not add **.0** to the end of a number. This is extra text that does not increase understanding. Just use the whole number.

> Example: 
> There is $10.5 million in funding for the program.
> Nearly 40 million people live in California.

For rates that use million as their base, write out the word “million.”

> Example: 
> Unvaccinated deaths per million: 7.2

When writing numbers with limited space (like labels in a chart), use an M instead of writing out the full number.

> Example:
> $15M in funding

### Commas

Use commas in numbers over 999. People have trouble understanding more than three numbers in a row. Commas break up the number and make it easier for people to read.

> Example: 
> 15,000 testing sites

### Decimals
Use decimals only when you need to. This reduces the amount of numbers people have to read. Only go to one decimal place in most situations. 

Example: 
> 78.6% of population vaccinated
> 0.1 new deaths 

Use more than one decimal place when using this rule or rounding would cause you to show a value as 0 when it is not truly 0. This most often comes into play when reporting data. 

> Example:
> .04 deaths per 100K

### Fractions

Write fractions using a slash. This is more accurate than using decimal places. It’s also easier for people to understand.

> Example:
> About 2/3 of California’s cities and counties do not allow cannabis retail activity.

Do not use 0.0.

Use 2 decimal places if you’re writing a price that isn’t a round number.

> Example:
> The cost of a new license is $29.99.

### Numerals

In sentences, use numerals for all numbers, except for “one.” People recognize numerals more easily than numbers written as words. This is especially true when people scan text. Scanning is common when reading on a screen.

> Examples:
> Choose one of the following options.
> There are 3 information sessions.

If you have to start a sentence with a number, write it out. Try to avoid starting sentences with numbers so you can use numerals.

> Example:
> Twelve cities in Los Angeles County allow cultivation of cannabis.

### Times

Use **AM** and **PM** with times. Put a space between the time and AM or PM. Convert times to the Pacific time zone. Unless your target audience is out of state, do not state the time zone since California is only in one time zone.

> Example:
> The press conference is at 10:30 AM.

If you use a dash when writing a time range, put a space between the dash and the times.

> Example:
> The statewide call center is open 7 days a week:
> * Monday through Friday, 8:00 AM - 8:00 PM   
> * Saturday and Sunday, 8:00 AM - 5:00 PM

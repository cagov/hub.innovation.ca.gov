description: How ODI keeps our writing consistent, including the reasons for our choices

These are the Office of Data and Innovation’s conventions and standard terms for writing. Our [content design principles](/content-design/principles/) provide general guidance in how to write well.

## Capitalization

Always use sentence case. It’s easier to read and understand. Only capitalize proper nouns and the first word of a sentence or bullet.

> Examples: 
> Your actions save lives
> Blueprint for a Safer Economy
> Public health orders are issued by the California Department of Public Health

When a word or phrase could correctly be written in title case or sentence case, default to sentence case.

When writing out a URL, use lowercase letters. But if it’s the first word in a sentence, capitalize the first letter.

> Examples:
> Check myturn.ca.gov for walk-in clinics in your area.
> Vaccines.gov is the CDC’s vaccination portal.

Capitalize acronyms.

> Example:
> CDC

Capitalize the suffix for time of day, and add a space before it.

> Example:
> 10:40 AM

When creating a link to a page or document on another website, use the same case for the link text that the visitor will find when they use the link.

> Example:
> [Fact Sheet: Omicron Variant](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Omicron-Variant-Fact-Sheet.aspx)

When making a bulleted list, capitalize the first word in each bullet.

> Example:
> The best thing we can do to limit virus spread and mutation is to:
> * Get vaccinated
> * Get your booster if you’re eligible

## Dates

Write out the month in a date. 

> Example: 
> January 15, 2022

Do not use only numbers, which can lead to confusion. Some cultures interpret 9/5/2020 as May 9, 2020 instead of September 5, 2020.

## Numbers

### Abbreviations

#### Thousands (K)

Write out the number. This is clear to people, even after translation.

> Example: 
> Grants of up to $15,000 are available.

When writing numbers with limited space (like labels in a chart), use a K instead of writing out the full number.

For rates that use 100,000 as their base, use “per 100K.”

> Example: 
> 15.2 cases per 100K

#### Millions (M)

For exact numbers where every digit is important, write out the whole number.

> Example: 
> 15,435,899 cases

For round or approximate numbers, write out the word “million.” Use up to one decimal point. Do not add .0 to the end of a number. This is extra text that does not increase understanding. Just use the whole number.

> Example: 
> There is $10.5 million in funding for the program.
> Nearly 40 million people live in California.

For rates that use million as their base, write out the word “million.”

> Example: 
> Unvaccinated deaths per million: 7.2

When writing numbers with limited space (like labels in a chart), use an M instead of writing out the full number.

> Example:
> $15M in funding

### Commas

Use commas in numbers over 999. People have trouble understanding more than three numbers in a row. Commas break up the number and make it easier for people to read.

> Example: 
> 15,000 testing sites

### Decimals
Use decimals only when you need to. This reduces the amount of numbers people have to read. Only go to one decimal place in most situations. 

Example: 
> 78.6% of population vaccinated
> 0.1 new deaths 

Use more than one decimal place when using this rule or rounding would cause you to show a value as 0 when it is not truly 0. This most often comes into play when reporting data. 

> Example:
> .04 deaths per 100K

### Fractions

Write fractions using a slash. This is more accurate than using decimal places. It’s also easier for people to understand.

> Example:
> About 2/3 of California’s cities and counties do not allow cannabis retail activity.

Do not use 0.0.

Use 2 decimal places if you’re writing a price that isn’t a round number.

> Example:
> The cost of a new license is $29.99.

### Numerals

In sentences, use numerals for all numbers, except for “one.” People recognize numerals more easily than numbers written as words. This is especially true when people scan text. Scanning is common when reading on a screen.

> Examples:
> Choose one of the following options.
> There are 3 information sessions.

If you have to start a sentence with a number, write it out. Try to avoid starting sentences with numbers so you can use numerals.

> Example:
> Twelve cities in Los Angeles County allow cultivation of cannabis.

### Times

Use **AM** and **PM** with times. Put a space between the time and AM or PM. Convert times to the Pacific time zone. Unless your target audience is out of state, do not state the time zone since California is only in one time zone.

> Example:
> The press conference is at 10:30 AM.

If you use a dash when writing a time range, put a space between the dash and the times.

> Example:
> The statewide call center is open 7 days a week:
> * Monday through Friday, 8:00 AM - 8:00 PM   
> * Saturday and Sunday, 8:00 AM - 5:00 PM

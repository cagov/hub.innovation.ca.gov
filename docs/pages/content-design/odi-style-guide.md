These are the Office of Data and Innovation’s conventions and standard terms for writing. Our [content design principles](/content-design/principles/) provide general guidance in how to write well.

## Capitalization

Always use sentence case. It’s easier to read and understand. Only capitalize proper nouns and the first word of a sentence or bullet.

> Examples: 
> Your actions save lives
> Blueprint for a Safer Economy
> Public health orders are issued by the California Department of Public Health

When a word or phrase could correctly be written in title case or sentence case, default to sentence case.

When writing out a URL, use lowercase letters. But if it’s the first word in a sentence, capitalize the first letter.

> Examples:
> Check myturn.ca.gov for walk-in clinics in your area.
> Vaccines.gov is the CDC’s vaccination portal.

Capitalize acronyms.

> Example:
> CDC

Capitalize the suffix for time of day, and add a space before it.

> Example:
> 10:40 AM

When creating a link to a page or document on another website, use the same case for the link text that the visitor will find when they use the link.

> Example:
> [Fact Sheet: Omicron Variant](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Omicron-Variant-Fact-Sheet.aspx)

When making a bulleted list, capitalize the first word in each bullet.

> Example:
> The best thing we can do to limit virus spread and mutation is to:
> * Get vaccinated
> * Get your booster if you’re eligible

## Dates

Write out the month in a date. 

> Example: 
> January 15, 2022

Do not use only numbers, which can lead to confusion. Some cultures interpret 9/5/2020 as May 9, 2020 instead of September 5, 2020.

## Numbers

### Abbreviations

#### Thousands (K)

Write out the number. This is clear to people, even after translation.

> Example: 
> Grants of up to $15,000 are available.

When writing numbers with limited space (like labels in a chart), use a K instead of writing out the full number.

For rates that use 100,000 as their base, use “per 100K.”

> Example: 
> 15.2 cases per 100K

#### Millions (M)

For exact numbers where every digit is important, write out the whole number.

> Example: 
> 15,435,899 cases

For round or approximate numbers, write out the word “million.” Use up to one decimal point. Do not add .0 to the end of a number. This is extra text that does not increase understanding. Just use the whole number.

> Example: 
> There is $10.5 million in funding for the program.
> Nearly 40 million people live in California.

For rates that use million as their base, write out the word “million.”

> Example: 
> Unvaccinated deaths per million: 7.2

When writing numbers with limited space (like labels in a chart), use an M instead of writing out the full number.

> Example:
> $15M in funding

### Commas

Use commas in numbers over 999. People have trouble understanding more than three numbers in a row. Commas break up the number and make it easier for people to read.

> Example: 
> 15,000 testing sites

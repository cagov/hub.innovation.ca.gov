title: Plain language equity standard
description: ODIâ€™s recommendations for how to help everyone understand content
---

<p class="text-lead">All state departments should:</p>

* Provide information to the public at an 8th grade reading level or lower
* Use smaller, more common words
* Avoid jargon and technical terms as much as possible
* Keep sentences short and simple

This standard applies to print and digital information.

## Key considerations

It can be a challenge to balance plain language and accuracy. Achieve the lowest reading level you can.

Write for your audience. Using technical terms might be appropriate if you're writing for a specialized audience. Examples include attorneys, scientists, or engineers.

Cite laws, code, or regulations as written. Summarize this information whenever possible to help people understand it.

## Definitions

* Code: The text of laws, as found at [California Legislative Information](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/)
* Department: A department, commission, office, or other administrative agency of state government
* Jargon: Words used by specialists that are not used or understood by the average person

## Where to start

* Begin with documents you are already working on.
* Focus on documents that have the highest impact on outcomes for Californians like:
  * Applications
  * Appeals
* When addressing language access issues, start by writing in plain language in English.

| **Category** | **Rating** | **Tips** |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| [Written for easy reading by the average reader](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/audience/) | Grade 0-14 reading level, plus Postgraduate | Measure reading level to make sure it’s not too high for your audience. Check this through [Hemingway](https://hemingwayapp.com/). Target is 6th-8th Grade level. |
| [Organized to serve the reader’s needs](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/organize/) | Yes, No, N/A | Content should be organized around what the reader wants to know and their potential next steps. |
| [Has useful headings](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/organize/add-useful-headings/) | Yes, No, N/A | Content should be organized around what the reader wants to know and their potential next steps. |
| [Has useful headings](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/organize/add-useful-headings/) | Yes, No, N/A | Headings act as landmarks that help people understand what they are about to read, so make these as clear as possible. For example, including “Unemployment insurance benefits” in your heading makes it clear to claimants which benefits they are about to read about, which can be helpful if individuals have applied for multiple benefits. |
| [Uses sentence case](https://readabilityguidelines.co.uk/grammar-points/capital-letters/), even in titles and headings | Yes, No, N/A | Capitalize only proper nouns and the first word in sentences. This makes text easier to read and understand. |
| [Uses “you” and other pronouns to speak to readers](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/audience/address-the-user/) | Yes, No, N/A | Addressing the reader directly and using a human-centered tone helps readers understand what is relevant to them. |
| Uses [short sections](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/concise/write-short-sections/) and [short sentences](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/concise/write-short-sentences/) | Yes, No, N/A | Overly complex sentences can be hard to parse. Review long sentences for core points and break them up into shorter sentences, grouping them by theme or timeline of events to increase clarity. |
| [Uses the simplest tense possible](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/conversational/use-the-present-tense/) | Yes, No, N/A | Speak in the present tense. Simple present is best. |
| [Omits excessive words](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/concise/write-short-sentences/) | Yes, No, N/A | Have one main idea per sentence. |
| [Uses common, familiar words](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/words/use-simple-words-phrases/) | Yes, No, N/A | Avoid legalese, jargon, and figurative language. |
| [Places words carefully](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/words/place-words-carefully/) | Yes, No, N/A | Avoid large gaps between the subject, the verb, and the object. Put exceptions last. Place modifiers correctly. |
| [Uses lists](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/organize/use-lists/) and [tables](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/design/use-tables-to-make-complex-material-easier-to-understand/) to simplify complex material | Yes, No, N/A | When possible, provide information in lists, which are easier to process than large chunks of text. Tables can be used for more complex material. |

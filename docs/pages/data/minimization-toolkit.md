Data minimization helps departments collect, store, and share information safely and responsibly. It builds trust in government and reduces risk.

Use this to start improving data privacy and minimization in your program.

Contact us with questions, feedback, or to share your experience using the toolkit at caldata@innovation.ca.gov. We update the toolkit when needs change.

Choose what best describes your need to start your journey.

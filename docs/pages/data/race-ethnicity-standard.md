<p class="text-lead">The purpose of this data standard is to support the consistent collection, analysis, and reporting of data on race and ethnicity across state departments and agencies.</p>

Standardized race and ethnicity data collection and analysis will:

* Improve statewide capacity for tracking and comparing demographic differences across state services and programs
* Help inform policy and programs changes to identify and improve access and outcomes across state services and programs for all Californians

## Introduction

Collecting and analyzing race and ethnicity data is essential for ensuring California state government programs and policies serve all residents fairly and effectively. When state agencies lack reliable data about how different racial and ethnic groups access and experience their services, they may unintentionally overlook or perpetuate inequities. Good data collection allows agencies to identify disparities in program participation, outcomes, and quality of services across California’s diverse communities.

      For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the California Department of Public Health’s ability to collect and analyze vaccination data using <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2021/03/04/california-leads-with-public-health-and-vaccine-equity-to-safely-and-sustainably-reopen/">equity metrics like the Healthy Places Index</a> helped them recognize gaps in vaccine access across different race and ethnicity groups. This allowed for the implementation of targeted solutions, like establishing vaccination sites in the most impacted neighborhoods and partnering with community organizations to reach underserved populations.

However, collecting this data must be done thoughtfully and responsibly, with clear purpose and strong protections for privacy and confidentiality.

* California state agencies should only gather race and ethnicity information when they have a specific plan for using it to improve equity in their programs and services.
* The data collection process should respect residents’ autonomy and privacy by making responses voluntary and clearly explaining how their information will be used.
* Engaging directly with communities through partnerships with local organizations and resident feedback can help ensure data collection methods are culturally appropriate and reflect California’s unique demographic diversity.

Demographic data collection and analysis can be powerful tools for making California state government programs work better for all of California’s residents.

## Example of the Race & Ethnicity data collection question

The figure below illustrates an example of what the race and ethnicity data standard would look like when implemented in a survey. It allows respondents to select multiple options, lists examples of detailed categories for each group, and allows for a write-in option.

This is just one example of how this data standard could be implemented. State programs may require different implementations of this standard depending on how they intend to collect the data – such as through digital interfaces, paper forms, or through interviewer questions.

## Scope of responsibilities for users

While we encourage all state programs serving Californians to collect race and ethnicity data where appropriate, this order does not mandate the new collection of any race and ethnicity data. However, all state agencies and departments currently collecting race and ethnicity data should adhere to this standard.

Any new systems that will collect race and ethnicity data should be able to technically comply with this standard. Existing systems may be unable to meet the requirements of the standard due to technical limitations or costs to upgrading. Departments should identify a sunset date for systems incapable of meeting the standard, and any replacement systems should comply with this standard.

This standard is designed to be flexible enough to meet a large majority of state departments’ existing reporting requirements, but does not supersede other legally required data collection standards particular to individual departments.

## Data collection

### Collection principles

* **Self-identification and self-reporting is preferred.** Respect for individual dignity should guide the processes and methods for collecting data on race and ethnicity. Use self-identification when feasible and practical. If self-identification is not feasible or practical at the point of collection, departments should provide a later opportunity for individuals to self-identify.
    * **Alternative methods**: When collecting data intended for federal program reporting and respondent self-identification is not possible, data may be collected by:
        * *Proxy reporting*, where a person knowledgeable of another’s race and/or ethnicity responds on their behalf;
        * *Record matching*, where existing records on an individual that contain their race and/or ethnicity are used to supply the information;
        * *Observer identification*, where an observer uses their best judgement of the most appropriate race and/or ethnicity categories in which to report an individual. If it is necessary to collect data on race and ethnicity via observation, only the top-level categories should be used. 
* **Document data collection mode**: Document how this data was collected, for example, by self-report, observation, proxy, or another data collection method. Examples of phrasing that may be used to describe data collection methods include: self-reported, proxy-reported, or observation identification. 
* **Document data imputation and coding methods**: When coding write-in data, imputing missing data, or otherwise editing responses, agencies should adopt practices that maximize comparability between data collected on forms and surveys with and without write-in fields.
    * State departments should maintain records on data processing procedures (such as coding, editing, and imputation practices), and make that information available to data users to allow them to evaluate the utility, objectivity, and integrity of the data.
    * State departments should maintain records on nonresponse or other missing data were assigned or allocated, and should make that information available to data users to allow them to evaluate the utility, objectivity, and integrity of the data. 
* **Paper vs. electronic vs. interview formats**: Race and ethnicity data collection language should be adapted for their medium. In particular, collections done on paper should ask “What is your race and/or ethnicity? **Mark** all that apply” as opposed to “What is your race and/or ethnicity? **Select** all that apply” in electronic collections.

### Race and ethnicity data categories

Detailed categories allow for the further disaggregation of race and ethnicity data to uncover meaningful differences by subgroups. While privacy risks may limit the public sharing of some detailed subgroups with the public, detailed categories can inform internal analysis and policy decisions.

A combined race and ethnicity question is required for both self-response and proxy data collection. Respondents should be offered a single combined race and ethnicity question that allows them to select one category or multiple categories. A single selection will be considered a complete response (e.g., Hispanic or Latino respondents are not required to select an additional category).

State departments and agencies should use the 7 top-level categories defined in Table 1 in their race and ethnicity data collection. For each of the top-level categories, state entities should offer the detailed categories along with a write-in option (listed in Table 2) in their data collection system. If a write-in option is not feasible, departments may choose to create an “another” category for each group.

The top-level category set is sorted by alphabetical order. The detailed category set is sorted by population prevalence to assist respondents in locating their detailed race or ethnicity within the subgroup.


**Table 1: Top-level set of race and ethnicity categories**
<div class="twocolumn-table">

| **Top-level category**                  | **Definition** |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------- | 
| **American Indian or Alaska Native**    | Individuals with origins in any of the original peoples of North, Central, and South America, including, for example, Navajo Nation, Blackfeet Tribe of the Blackfeet Indian Reservation of Montana, Native Village of Barrow Inupiat Traditional Government, Nome Eskimo Community, Aztec, and Maya. |
| **Asian**                               | Individuals with origins in any of the original peoples of Central or East Asia, Southeast Asia, or South Asia, including, for example, Chinese, Asian Indian, Filipino, Vietnamese, Korean, and Japanese. |
| **Black or African American**           | Individuals with origins in any of the Black racial groups of Africa, including, for example, African American, Jamaican, Haitian, Nigerian, Ethiopian, and Somali. |
| **Hispanic or Latino**                  | Includes individuals of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Salvadoran, Cuban, Dominican, Guatemalan, and other Central or South American or Spanish culture or origin. |
| **Middle Eastern or North African**     | Individuals with origins in any of the original peoples of the Middle East or North Africa, including, for example, Lebanese, Iranian, Egyptian, Syrian, Iraqi, and Israeli. |
| **Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander** | Individuals with origins in any of the original peoples of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, or other Pacific Islands, including, for example, Native Hawaiian, Samoan, Chamorro, Tongan, Fijian, and Marshallese. |
| **White**                               | Individuals with origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, including, for example, English, German, Irish, Italian, Polish, and Scottish. |

Table 2 below is a recommended set of detailed category groups ordered by population prevalence within each top-level category within the state of California. These population figures are based on the 2020 Decennial Census Detailed Race/Ethnicity population estimates for California contained in the [DHC-A](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2022/2020-census-data-products-schedule-2023.html).

The top six (6) most populous subgroups within each top-level category within California are listed as checkbox options, with the next three (3) most populous groups listed as examples preceding the write-in option.

Note: The Asian top-level category has 8 options due to state code requirements specified in [8310.5](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=GOV&sectionNum=8310.5.).

      <b>Note</b>: The Federal SPD-15 guidelines recommend including a write-in option only for American Indian or Alaska Native. Alternatively, departments may consider the following three subcategory write-in options for the AIAN category for encouraging the collection of detailed categories of AIAN communities. These categories were derived at the recommendation of the Natives Count working group. <ul><li>North American Indian or Alaska Native – Includes all individuals who identify with any of the original peoples of North America other than the First Nations of Canada.

</div>

### Adding additional detailed categories

Departments are not limited to the recommended set of detailed categories. Depending on the research, legal, program, or unique business needs, departments may extend these detailed category options to facilitate better data collection.
Departments should choose additional detailed categories from the Census’ American Community Survey (ACS), which provides yearly population estimates. For a more exhaustive list of detailed categories, refer to the complete [ACS codelist](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/code-lists.html).

*Question instruction.* Respondents shall be offered the option of selecting one or more racial and ethnic designations. The question instructions will vary depending on whether there is a write-in field or if there are detailed categories. 

* For questions with detailed categories and no write-in fields, the question instructions should read: “What is your race and/or ethnicity? Select all that apply.” 
* When write-in fields are provided, the instructions should read: “What is your race and/or ethnicity? Select all that apply and enter additional details in the spaces below.”
* When collecting only the minimum categories, the question instructions should read “What is your race and/or ethnicity? Select all that apply.”

### Opting out

State departments should collect detailed data on race and ethnicity beyond the minimum categories, unless an agency determines that the potential benefit of the detailed data would not justify the additional burden to the agency and the public or the additional risk to privacy or confidentiality. In those cases, state departments should at least use the top-level categories in their data collection.

### Existing legislative data collection mandates

The detailed category requirements of this standard do not replace any existing legislative data collection requirements your department may face.

## Data reporting best practices

The top-level and detailed race and ethnicity categories described in this standard should enable flexible and disaggregated analysis and reporting.

When reporting top-level and detailed category data:

* Enable detailed analysis while protecting privacy
    * Report detailed categories when privacy policies allow
    * Capture nuances between detailed groups that may be lost in top-level aggregation
* Document data quality
    * Report percentage of missing data/non-responses
    * Note potential response bias across groups
    * Use caution with potentially unrepresentative data, where groups may be less willing or comfortable reporting this information
* Maintain Census compatibility
    * Aggregate back to the top-level race and ethnicity categories
    * Categories must roll up to Census master codelist

Report out detailed category information in alignment with [8310.9(b)2](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=GOV&sectionNum=8310.9.). This aligns with Approaches #1 and #2 in the techniques described below.

### Race and ethnicity data reporting

Organizations should choose their reporting approach based on:

* Specific analysis needs
* Available resources for data collection and analysis
* Required level of detail
* Intended use of the data
* Reporting requirements
* Sample size considerations

There are three common approaches for reporting race and ethnicity data:

#### 1. Combined Reporting (“Alone or in Combination“)

In this approach, data for individuals identifying with any specific racial or ethnicity group (alone or in combination) are combined. For example, a respondent who identifies as both “White” and “Black or African American” would be represented in two categories and appear twice in the data:

* White alone or in combination
* Black or African American alone or in combination.

**List of groups**

* American Indian or Alaska Native alone or in combination
* Asian alone or in combination
* Black or African American alone or in combination
* Hispanic or Latino alone or in combination
* Middle Eastern or North African alone or in combination
* Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander alone or in combination
* White alone or in combination

**Best uses**

* Analyzing health disparities or discrimination across groups
* Understanding service utilization patterns
* Tracking outcomes that affect multiple communities

**Limitations**

* Creates duplicate counts (total will exceed 100%)
* Not suitable for population size calculations
* Can complicate statistical analysis

#### 2. Separate single & multiple identity reporting

This approach creates two distinct reporting sections: one for people who identify with a single race/ethnicity, and another that details specific combinations of multiple identities. This preserves detail while avoiding double-counting.

**Single identity categories**

* American Indian and Alaska Native alone
* Asian alone
* Black or African American alone
* Hispanic or Latino alone
* Middle Eastern or North African alone
* Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander alone
* White alone

**Common multiple identity combinations**

* American Indian/Alaska Native + White
* Asian + White
* Black or African American + White
* Hispanic or Latino + White
* *[Add additional relevant combinations as needed for your program]*

**Best uses**

* Accurate population count
* Detailed demographic analysis
* Program planning requiring precise numbers
* Budget allocations based on population size

**Limitations**

* More complex to implement
* Requires more detailed data collection
* Can result in small sample sizes for specific combinations, affecting respondent privacy and statistical power

#### 3. Single identity reporting with a multiracial and multiethnic category

Report on individuals who identify with a single race or ethnicity and a “Multiracial and Multiethnic” group for individuals identifying as more than one race and/or ethnicity.

An example of how data might be reported using this approach is presented below:

* American Indian or Alaska Native alone
* Asian alone
* Black or African American alone
* Hispanic or Latino alone
* Middle Eastern or North African alone
* Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander alone
* White alone
* Multiracial and Multiethnic


<div class="blockquote-container">
  <div class="blockquote-body">
    <div class="blockquote-content">
      <b>Note</b>: Approach #3 should be used together with either Approach #1 or #2 to provide sufficient detail about population diversity.
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

**Best uses**

* Initial data analysis
* High-level demographic overviews
* Situations requiring simplified reporting
* When sample sizes are small

**Limitations**

* Masks important demographic details
* Oversimplifies community diversity
* Not recommended as a standalone approach
* May not meet federal reporting requirements

## Race and ethnicity data standard governance

For the purposes of this standard, we adopt the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) SPD-15 standard [definition of race and ethnicity](https://spd15revision.gov/content/spd15revision/en/faqs.html) in that these terms “represent a sociopolitical construct designed to be used in the self-reported or observed collection of data on the race and ethnicity of major broad population groups in this country and are not biologically or genetically based.”

**These categories should not be used to discriminate between population groups or for determining the eligibility of population groups for participation in any State programs.**

### Alignment with existing frameworks

Building on the foundation of existing research and best practices, this California race and ethnicity data standard offers guidance on demographic data collection best practices to help state departments reflect the diversity of California’s communities. This guidance also incorporates race and ethnicity data collection requirements specified in state code for California state departments and agencies.

In particular, the race and ethnicity categories described in this standard draw from extensive statistical testing and stakeholder engagement conducted by the Census Bureau in the [2015 National Content Test](https://www.test.census.gov/library/video/2017/nct-race-ethnicity.html#:~:text=The%202015%20National%20Content%20Test%20is%20part%20of%20the%20research,data%20on%20race%20and%20ethnicity.) (NCT) and the [OMB’s SPD-15 revision in 2024](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/03/29/2024-06469/revisions-to-ombs-statistical-policy-directive-no-15-standards-for-maintaining-collecting-and). The California race and ethnicity data standard adopts the same structure as the OMB 2024 SPD-15 race and ethnicity data collection and supports tabulation and reporting of data collections to meet anticipated federal reporting requirements. Adopting the California race and ethnicity data standard also demonstrates compliance with the federal SPD-15 race and ethnicity data standard.

As best practices and statutory requirements shift, this data standard will be updated over time to reflect new changes.

### Iterative release process

As part of a wider framework on demographic data collection and analysis, this race and ethnicity data standard will be updated and refined through an iterative release process. These updates will be informed by stakeholder engagement and feedback synthesis with state users.

Additional demographic data standards are also anticipated for release throughout 2025. These additional data standards will integrate with this race and ethnicity data standard to ensure interoperability and intersectional analysis.

Further detailed guidance and resources for users of this standard will be released through a separate toolkit. This toolkit is intended to be a complementary resource to the race and ethnicity data standard and will be updated on an ongoing basis based on community engagement, user feedback, and evolving best practices in the field. This toolkit will eventually offer guidelines on bridging data collected between differing data standards, data collection templates for simplifying adoption of this data standard, and best practice guidance for developing equity metrics and analyzing demographic data to improve state programs.

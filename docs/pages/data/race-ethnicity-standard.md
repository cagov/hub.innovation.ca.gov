<p class="text-lead">The purpose of this data standard is to support the consistent collection, analysis, and reporting of data on race and ethnicity across state departments and agencies.</p>

Standardized race and ethnicity data collection and analysis will:

* Improve statewide capacity for tracking and comparing demographic differences across state services and programs
* Help inform policy and programs changes to identify and improve access and outcomes across state services and programs for all Californians

##Introduction

Collecting and analyzing race and ethnicity data is essential for ensuring California state government programs and policies serve all residents fairly and effectively. When state agencies lack reliable data about how different racial and ethnic groups access and experience their services, they may unintentionally overlook or perpetuate inequities. Good data collection allows agencies to identify disparities in program participation, outcomes, and quality of services across California's diverse communities.

      For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the California Department of Public Health's ability to collect and analyze vaccination data using [equity metrics like the Healthy Places Index](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2021/03/04/california-leads-with-public-health-and-vaccine-equity-to-safely-and-sustainably-reopen/) helped them recognize gaps in vaccine access across different race and ethnicity groups. This allowed for the implementation of targeted solutions, like establishing vaccination sites in the most impacted neighborhoods and partnering with community organizations to reach underserved populations.

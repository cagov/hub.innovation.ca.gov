## Problem statement

Currently, California has an ambitious goal of permitting the construction of 2.5 million homes by 2030 with 1 million homes being affordable for lower income levels.  While significant progress has occurred since that target was set in 2022, there is still more that can be done to permit and build more affordable housing faster.

[Senate Bill (SB) 423](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB423) (D-Weiner-San Francisco), Land use: streamlined housing approvals: multifamily housing developments; [Assembly Bill (AB) 2653](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB2653) (D-Santiago-Los Angeles), Planning and Zoning Law: housing elements; and other housing legislation have aimed to alleviate California’s housing production shortfall by building more affordable housing faster. However, the legislation has also led to a larger volume of housing data flowing to the Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD), requiring additional data processing and validation on a shorter time frame.

This makes it a time-consuming task to answer fundamental questions such as: 

* Which projects are eligible for streamlining under SB 423 (and which are not)?
* How long does it take to permit housing projects?
* How many projects are affordable? And how have trends in affordability changed over time? 

These questions must be answered to build rapidly and responsibly.

## Our approach

Housing production data is reported to HCD by 539 jurisdictions (cities and counties) across the state. ODI partnered with HCD to build a tool called *Homestead* to mine, analyze, and visualize that data so HCD staff can have in-depth, granular knowledge on the state of housing production. The housing development process itself can be mired in review and with each jurisdiction comes a different set of project identifiers, local procedures, and reporting practices.

<img src="/papers/madani-housing-1/bhi-fig-1.png" alt="539 jurisdictions are responsible for reporting on local building permitting and development milestones. Each office has its own reporting standards and practices. Median income levels and housing costs are initially measured on the county level. There are 58 counties in California. Data from local offices is ultimately analyzed by a single statewide housing department, the California Department of Housing and Community Development." />
<b>Figure 1.</b> Both jurisdictions and counties generate data related to housing development and cost of housing. All of which is funneled to one statewide agency: the Department of Housing & Community Development.


Additionally, under AB 2653, HCD has 90 days to request corrections to reports from jurisdictions.

Building a tool to process this data and guide HCD’s analysis requires an array of functionality to: process data, detect anomalies, analyze geospatial data, and automate rote analyses. This requires a Python script that outputs new datasets derived from raw housing data and a dashboard that’s accessible department-wide.

### Anomaly detection

One of the primary goals of ODI’s work was to help HCD detect outliers and idiosyncratic values easily. This saves time while maintaining flexibility for HCD staff to conduct deeper investigations. We workshopped 3 approaches to anomaly detection:

1. **Z-scoring:** A technique that standardizes data by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation (ensuring all values share a common scale), then flagging Z-scores greater than a given threshold (typically 3). 
2. **Isolation forest:** Isolates outliers by creating binary partitions in data, identifying anomalies as data points requiring fewer partitions to separate them from the majority.
3. **Local outlier factor:** Calculates a local anomaly score for data points based on the density of “neighbors” nearby on a graph, revealing anomalies within their local context.

We coupled the Z-Scoring approach with text processing to flag anomalous values consistently. An anomalous value might include multi-unit buildings that were reportedly built in less than a week or multiple parcels bundled together as one record. The final dashboard will have an interface for HCD staff to filter for and export projects with anomalous values.

<img src="/papers/madani-housing-1/bhi-fig-2.png" alt="An illustration of how Homestead identifies anomalies. It shows two stre ets of housing. One took 45 days-to-permit. Another took 48 days-to-permit. The next took 50-days-to-permit. Highlighted is a property that took 200 days-to-permit." />
<b>Figure 2.</b> Using development milestones like permit issuance and certificate of occupancy dates, we can flag developments with inordinately long timelines relative to comparable constructions.

### Geospatial analysis

One of the greatest challenges to making sense of housing data is the inconsistency between geographic data and jurisdiction-reported data. The inconsistency makes it impossible for a human to efficiently detect which projects are eligible for streamlining under SB 423 and which are not eligible for streamlining because they are in sensitive areas (for example, fire hazard, seismic hazard, or important farmland). We built a process to parse addresses, find the addresses’ coordinates, and map them against environmentally sensitive zones: 

1. **Geolocation functionality:** Map every project’s physical street address reported by jurisdictions (for example, 123 Main St. Los Angeles, CA 90720) to a latitude and longitude
2. **Shape processing:** Ingest and simplify shape files that represent California’s protected zones
3. **Spatial joining:** Map projects and protected zones to see which projects intersect with protected zones. Those that do not and meet SB 423 criteria are eligible for streamlining

<img src="/papers/madani-housing-1/bhi-fig-3.png" alt="This example shows the same two streets with coordinates for some homes. Some homes are in a fire hazard zone." />
<b>Figure 3.</b> By mapping shape files representing sensitive geographic areas and project addresses, we can determine geographic eligibility for streamlining.

### Automation

Lastly, we wanted *Homestead* to automate tasks that would otherwise take up large swaths of time, chipping away at the 90-day deadline HCD has to request corrections to reports. Repeatedly analyzing affordability using spreadsheets is one such task. Previously, inputs would need to be fed to a macro-enabled Excel file that would calculate affordability on a one-off basis for each individual unit size and county. 

ODI and HCD worked together to convert logic from the Excel file to code. Using the logic and inputs from various government datasets, we are able to calculate affordable rent for every county, unit type/size, and year. The result is a dataset that we can build upon to have reliable, up-to-date, and visible affordability metrics.

## Impact

Manual processes have costs beyond the actual hours spent on the review itself. Every hour of manual review takes away an hour from a deeper analysis and other tasks. *Homestead* helps reclaim time; the program runs overnight (~6 hour run-time), **potentially saving HCD nearly 2,000 manual review hours every year**.

“A manual data review process would require a full-time HCD staff member to work every hour for an entire year. That’s about 2,000 hours.” - HCD Sr. Housing Data Specialist

In the initial trial run, *Homestead* has demonstrated the following results: 
* Tagged **400,000** projects over the last 5 years as eligible or ineligible for SB 423 streamlining (all future applications should be automatically flagged).
  * **1,800** reported as SB 423 projects were identified as likely ineligible for streamlining or incorrectly reported.
  * Provided new visibility into housing costs by county, income level, and unit size over the last decade. This covers **all 58 counties across the state**.
* Stitched together a timeline of each project’s milestones and produces a report for every jurisdiction’s time-to-build, allowing HCD to identify the areas with the most acute need for streamlining going forward.   

## Recommendations

*Homestead* relies on underlying housing data from jurisdictions. Therefore, we must prioritize making the data collection process as robust as possible. This includes more guidance for jurisdictions and validation in the reporting process, before eventually transitioning to a standardized reporting form (or open data standard). Additionally, *Homestead*’s output datasets are meant to be built upon and extended. The more the tool is accessible by HCD staff, the more assets (for example, graphs, metrics, or flags) can be used moving forward. 

“Building more affordable housing faster” is a daunting mandate without the requisite tools. ODI and HCD are optimistic that better housing intelligence through *Homestead* is a vital step towards understanding and addressing the affordable housing shortfall in California.
